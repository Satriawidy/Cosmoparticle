# Cosmoparticle

This is a repository for several experimental numeric calculation related to cosmology and particle physics. The repository mainly consists of efforts on reproducing numerical results or plots from certain books or papers. This is a work-in-progress, so additional files are expected to coming later.

Currently, the repository consists of:
1. Efforts on reproducing the plot of effective degree of freedom associated with entropy in early universe, inspired by the work in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04979.
